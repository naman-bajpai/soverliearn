A decentralized tutoring platform where the "truth" of the educational content is verified on-chain via Seda. It uses Kairo to ensure the AI tutor isn't being "jailbroken" into giving students the answers instead of teaching them the logic.

The Twist: Use Overshoot AI to scale the compute, ensuring the tutor stays performant even with thousands of concurrent students.

Why it wins: It addresses the "AI cheating" epidemic in education while using a sophisticated security stack (Kairo).
